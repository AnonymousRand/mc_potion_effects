# Potion-Effects-1.16.1

Forge mod for Minecraft 1.16.1. Used for recording videos.

# Installation guide:

1. Click on "Releases" near the right side of the screen
2. Download the jar file from the release you want under the "Assets" tab (unlike with modded clients, you do not need to download the source code zip files; those only provide the code for the mod and not the runnable file itself)
3. Put the jar file into your mods folder in .minecraft (default location of .minecraft can be accessed by pressing WindowsKey + R and typing in "%AppData%" without the quotation marks)
4. Download and install Minecraft Forge (go to https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/ and download the installer for the version that you want to use, then run the installer and follow its directions)
5. Lauch the game using a Forge installation and the mod should be loaded
